│  Surge                  │
│  - **SUMMARY**:         │
│    - A massive          │
│  container ship has     │
│  blocked the Suez       │
│  Canal, halting         │
│  traffic and causing    │
│  significant delays.    │
│    - Freight rates for  │
│  key trade routes have  │
│  spiked, particularly   │
│  for Asia-Europe        │
│  routes.                │
│    - Analysts warn of   │
│  potential supply       │
│  chain disruptions and  │
│  increased costs for    │
│  global trade.          │
│  - **INDIA IMPACT       │
│  (CRITICAL)**:          │
│    - Indian exporters,  │
│  particularly those     │
│  shipping to Europe,    │
│  may face delays and    │
│  higher freight costs.  │
│    - Importers relying  │
│  on European goods      │
│  could experience       │
│  supply chain           │
│  disruptions and price  │
│  increases.             │
│  - **WHO SHOULD         │
│  CARE**:                │
│    - Exporters to       │
│  Europe (e.g.,          │
│  textiles,              │
│  pharmaceuticals).      │
│    - Importers of       │

│  US-China Trade         │
│  Tensions Escalate,     │
│  Tariffs on Chinese     │
│  Goods Increased        │
│  - **SUMMARY**:         │
│    - The US has         │
│  announced new tariffs  │
│  on Chinese goods,      │
│  escalating the         │
│  ongoing trade war.     │
│    - Chinese exporters  │
│  are likely to face     │
│  higher costs,          │
│  potentially impacting  │
│  global supply chains.  │
│    - Analysts predict   │
│  a shift in trade       │
│  routes as companies    │
│  seek alternative       │
│  suppliers.             │
│  - **INDIA IMPACT       │
│  (CRITICAL)**:          │
│    - Indian exporters   │
│  may benefit from a     │
│  shift in trade away    │
│  from China,            │
│  particularly in        │
